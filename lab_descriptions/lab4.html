<h3>
Testing
</h3>

<p>
Here are some ideas for tests.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
A rule with no common variable names.
<li>
A rule with more than one common variable name.
<li>
A rule with variables in the head
listed in a different order from
variables in the body.
</ol>



<h3>
New Database Operations
</h3>

<p>
Add join and union operations to the
Relation class from the last project.
</p>

<h4>
Join
</h4>

<p>
Join must be able to join two relations
that have no common attribute names.
</p>

<p>
Join must be able to join two relations
that have multiple common attribute names.
</p>

<p>
The following pseudo-code describes one way to
compute the join of relations r1 and r2.
</p>

<pre>
	make the scheme s for the result relation
	    (combine r1's scheme with r2's scheme)

	make a new empty relation r using scheme s

	for each tuple t1 in r1
	    for each tuple t2 in r2

		if t1 and t2 can join
		    join t1 and t2 to make tuple t
		    add tuple t to relation r
		end if

	    end for
	end for
</pre>

<p>
Note that the following operations used in the join
should be decomposed into separate routines.
</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>
	combining r1's scheme with r2's scheme
<li>
	testing t1 and t2 to see if they can join
<li>
	joining t1 and t2
</ol>


<h4>
Project
</h4>

<p>
The project operation from the last project
may need to be improved to support evaluating rules.
The project operation needs to be able to
change the order of the columns in a relation
to support evaluating rules.
</p>

<p>
Test the new database operations before using them
to evaluate rules as described in the next section.
</p>

 
 
<h3>
Evaluating Rules
</h3>
 
<p>
Add rule evaluation to the query interpreter
from the last project.
The major steps of the interpreter are:
</p>
 
<ol>
<li>
Process the schemes (same as the last project)
<li>
Process the facts (same as the last project)
<li>
Evaluate the rules (new code)
<li>
Evaluate the queries (same as the last project)
</ol>
 
<p>
Evaluate each rule using relational algebra operations as follows:
</p>
 
<ol>
<li>
For each predicate on the right hand side of a rule,
translate it into a sequence of select, project,
and rename operations exactly as you did for
the queries in the last project.
Each predicate should produce a single relation
as an intermediate result.
If there are n predicates on the right hand side of a rule,
there should be n intermediate results.
 
<li>
If there is a single predicate on the right hand side of the rule,
use the single intermediate result from Step 1
as the result for Step 2.
If there are two or more predicates on the right-hand side of a rule,
join the intermediate results to form the single result for Step 2.
Thus, if p1, p2, and p3 are the intermediate results from Step 1,
join them (p1 |x| p2 |x| p3) into a single relation.
 
<li>
The predicates in the body of a rule may have variables
that are not used in the head of the rule.
The variables in the head may also appear
in a different order than those in the body.
Use a project operation on the result from Step 2
to remove the columns that don't appear in the head of the rule
and to reorder the columns to match the order in the head.
 
<li>
Rename the relation that results from Step 3
to make it union compatible with the relation
that matches the head of the rule.
Rename each attribute in the result from Step 3
to the attribute name found in the corresponding position
in the relation that matches the head of the rule.
 
<li>
Union the result from Step 4 with the relation in the database
whose name matches the name of the head of the rule.
</ol>
 
<p>
Evaluate the rules in the order they are given in the input file. 
</p>



<h3>
The Fixed-Point Algorithm
</h3>
 
<p>
Use a fixed-point algorithm to repeatedly evaluate the rules.
If an iteration over the rules changes the database
by adding at least one new tuple to at least one relation
in the database, the algorithm evaluates the rules again.
If an iteration over the rules does not add a new tuple
to any relation in the database,
the fixed-point algorithm terminates.
</p>
 
<p>
An easy way to tell if any tuples were added to
the database is to count the number of tuples in
the database both before and after evaluating the rules.
If the two counts are different, something changed,
and the rules need to be evaluated again.
</p>



<h3>
Output Format
</h3>

<p>
The output for this project is composed of the following parts:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Scheme evaluation output (same as the last project)
<li>
Fact evaluation output (same as the last project)
<li>
Rule evaluation output (described in the next section)
<li>
Query evaluation output (same as the last project)
</ol>



<h3>
Rule Evaluation Output
</h3>

<p>
Output a line with the text 'Rule Evaluation'
followed by a blank line.
</p>

<p>
For each rule that is evaluated,
output the rule followed by the tuples generated by the rule.
Output the rule in the same form
that it appears in a Datalog program.
Output each tuple in the same form as
in the previous project.
Output the tuples after the last step of the evaluation of the rule,
after the attributes have been renamed to be union compatible
with the relation that matches the head of the rule.
Only output the tuples that don't already exist
in the result relation.
</p>

<p>
After outputting all the evaluated rules, 
output a blank line followed by a line with the string,
</p>

<pre>
Converged after n passes through the Rules.
</pre>

<p>
where n is the number of times
the fixed-point algorithm evaluated the rules
before it converged to a solution.
</p>

<p>
Finally, output a blank line followed by
the contents of the relations in the database
in the same form used in the last project.
</p>

 
 
<h3>
Implementation Requirements
</h3>
 
<ol>
<li>
You are required to use a relational database
approach in solving the problem in this project.
You must create tuples in relations and evaluate rules
and queries using select, project, rename, and join operations.
 
<li>
Your solution must include the following classes:
Database, Relation, Scheme, and Tuple.

<li>
The Relation class must use a set data type
to hold the tuples in the relation.

<li>
The select, project, rename, union and join operations
must be implemented as functions in the Relation class.
 
<li>
Rules and queries must be evaluated using relational
operations (select, project, rename, join, and union).

<li>
The relational operators must not produce relations
with duplicate tuples or duplicate names in the scheme.

<li>
The program must run to completion
with a normal exit status for any input.
Do not terminate with a non-zero exit status for any input,
including inputs that have errors.
</ol>


 
<h3>
Assumptions
</h3>

<p>
You may assume the following about the datalog input:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
The head of every rule will only contain variable names.
No strings will be given in the head of any rule.

<li>
No two variable names in a rule head are the same.
Each variable in a rule head is unique in that rule head.

<li>
Every variable name in the head of a rule will appear in
at least one predicate in the body of the rule.
</ol>
