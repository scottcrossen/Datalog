<hr>

<p>
Note: Projects are to be completed by each student individually
(not by groups of students).
</p>


<p>
Write an interpreter that uses relational database
operations to evaluate the queries in a Datalog Program.
For this project, use only the facts to evaluate the queries.
(The evaluation of rules will be added in the next project.)
</p>



<h3>
Example Input
</h3>

<pre>
Schemes:
  SK(A,B)
Facts:
  SK('a','c').
  SK('b','c').
  SK('b','b').
  SK('b','c').
Rules:

Queries:
  SK(A,'c')?
  SK('b','c')?
  SK(X,X)?
  SK(A,B)?
  SK('c','c')?
</pre>

<h3>
Testing
</h3>

<p>
Here are some ideas for tests.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
A program with an empty fact list.
<li>
A program with a duplicate fact.
<li>
A query with a variable name listed more than once.
</ol>



<h3>
The Database Classes
</h3>

<p>
The solution for this project has two main parts,
(1) a simple relational database and
(2) an interpreter that uses the database to evaluate queries.
</p>
 
<p>
A relational database is a collection of relations.
A relation has a name, a scheme, and a set of tuples.
A scheme is a list of attribute names.
A tuple is a list of attribute values.
Relations are used as operands in relational operations
such as select, project, and rename.
</p>

<p>
In this project a Datalog program is represented by a database.
Each scheme in the program defines a relation in the database.
Each fact in the program defines a tuple in a relation.
</p>

<p>
Write classes that implement a simple relational database.
Your design must include at least the following classes:
Database, Relation, Scheme, and Tuple.
Provide functions in the Relation class for each of the
relational operations (select, project, and rename).
Each of these functions operates on an existing relation
and returns a new Relation (the result of the operation).
</p>

<p>
The Relation class must use a set data type
to hold the tuples in the relation.
</p>

<p>
Test your database classes before combining them with
the query interpreter described in the next section.
</p>

<p>
Decouple the database classes from the Datalog classes.
For example, don't have Tuples that contain Parameters.
</p>


 
<h3>
Datalog Program Evaluation
</h3>

<p>
Use the relational database classes to evaluate
the Datalog program using these major steps:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Evaluate the schemes.
<li>
Evaluate the facts.
<li>
Evaluate the queries.
</ol>

 
<h3>
Evaluating Schemes
</h3>

<p>
Start with an empty Database.
For each scheme in the Datalog program,
add an empty Relation to the Database.
Use the scheme name as the name of the relation and
the attribute list from the scheme as the scheme of the relation.
</p>


<h3>
Scheme Evaluation Output
</h3>

<p>
Output a line with the text 'Scheme Evaluation'
followed by a blank line.
</p>


<h3>
Evaluating Facts
</h3>

<p>
For each fact in the Datalog program,
add a Tuple to a Relation.
Use the predicate name from the fact to determine
the Relation to which the Tuple should be added.
Use the values listed in the fact
to provide the values for the Tuple.
</p>


<h3>
Fact Evaluation Output
</h3>

<p>
Output a line with the text 'Fact Evaluation'
followed by a blank line,
followed by the contents of the relations in the database.
</p>

<p>
For each relation,
output the name of the relation on a line by itself,
followed by the tuples contained in the relation,
followed by a blank line.
</p>

<p>
Output each tuple on a separate line
as a space-separated list of pairs.
Each pair has the form N='V',
where N is the attribute name from the scheme
and V is the value from the tuple.
Output the name-value pairs
in the same order as the attribute names
in the scheme of the relation.
Indent the output of each tuple by two spaces.
</p>

<p>
Output the relations in sorted order.
Sort the relations alphabetically by the name of the relation.
</p>

<p>
Output the tuples in sorted order.
Sort the tuples alphabetically based on the values in the tuples.
Sort first by the value in the first position
and if needed up to the value in the nth position.
</p>


<h3>
Evaluating Queries
</h3>

<p>
For each query in the Datalog program,
use a sequence of select, project, and rename operations
on the Database to evaluate the query.
Evaluate the queries in the order given in the input.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Get the Relation from the Database
with the same name as the predicate name in the query.

<li>
Use the select operation to select the tuples
from the Relation that match the query.
Iterate over the parameters of the query:
If the parameter is a constant,
select the tuples from the Relation
that have the same value as the parameter
in the same position as the parameter.
If the parameter is a variable and
the same variable appears later in the query,
select the tuples from the Relation
that have the same value in both positions
where the variable appears.

<li>
After selecting the matching tuples,
use the project operation to keep only
the columns from the Relation that correspond
to the positions of the variables in the query.
Make sure that each variable name appears only
once in the resulting relation.

<li>
After projecting,
use the rename operation to
rename the scheme of the Relation
to the names of the variables found in the query. 
</ol>


<h3>
Query Evaluation Output
</h3>

<p>
For each query, output the query and a space.
If the relation resulting from evaluating
the query is empty, output 'No'.
If the resulting relation is not empty, output 'Yes(n)'
where n is the number of tuples in the resulting relation.
</p>

<p>
If the result of the query evaluation is 'Yes'
output the tuples that result from
the three steps of the query evaluation.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Output the text 'select' on a line by itself
followed by the tuples that result from the select step.

<li>
Output the text 'project' on a line by itself
followed by the tuples that result from the project step.

<li>
Output the text 'rename' on a line by itself
followed by the tuples that result from the rename step.
</ol>

<p>
Output each tuple in the same form as described
in the Fact Evaluation Output section.
</p>

<p>
Output a blank line following the output of each query.
</p>



<h3>
Implementation Requirements
</h3>

<ol>
<li>
You are required to use a relational database
approach in solving the problem in this project.
You must create tuples in relations and evaluate queries
using select, project, and rename operations.

<li>
Your solution must include the following classes:
Database, Relation, Scheme, and Tuple.

<li>
The Relation class must use a set data type
to hold the tuples in the relation.

<li>
The relational operations (select, project, and rename)
must be implemented as functions in the Relation class.
 
<li>
Queries must be evaluated using relational operations
(select, project, and rename).

<li>
The relational operators must not produce relations
with duplicate tuples or duplicate names in the scheme.

</ol> 



<h3>
Implementation Suggestions
</h3>

<ol>
<li>
<h4>
Select
</h4>

<p>
The select function could take two parameters,
a position and a value.
The given position in a tuple would need to
have a value equal to the given value
for that tuple to be included in the result.
</p>

<p>
Another select function could take two parameters
that are both positions.
The two given positions in a tuple
would need to have equal values
for that tuple to be included in the result.
</p>

<li>
<h4>
Project
</h4>

<p>
The parameter to the project function could be 
a list of the positions of the columns
that should be included in the result.
</p>

<p>
The project function needs to be able to
change the order of the columns in a relation
to support evaluating rules in the next project.
</p>
</ol>
