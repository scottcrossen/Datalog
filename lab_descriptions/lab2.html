Datalog Parser

<hr>

<p>
Note: Projects are to be completed by each student individually
(not by groups of students).
</p>


<p>
Write a parser that reads a datalog program from a text file,
builds a data structure that represents the datalog program,
and outputs the contents of the datalog program data structure.
</p>



<h3>
Example Input
</h3>

<pre>
Schemes:
  snap(S,N,A,P)
  HasSameAddress(X,Y)

Facts:
  snap('12345','C. Brown','12 Apple','555-1234').
  snap('33333','Snoopy','12 Apple','555-1234').

Rules:
  HasSameAddress(X,Y) :- snap(A,X,B,C),snap(D,Y,B,E).

Queries:
  HasSameAddress('Snoopy',Who)?
</pre>

  
  
<h3>
Example Output
</h3>

<pre>
Success!
Schemes(2):
  snap(S,N,A,P)
  HasSameAddress(X,Y)
Facts(2):
  snap('12345','C. Brown','12 Apple','555-1234')
  snap('33333','Snoopy','12 Apple','555-1234')
Rules(1):
  HasSameAddress(X,Y) :- snap(A,X,B,C),snap(D,Y,B,E)
Queries(1):
  HasSameAddress('Snoopy',Who)
Domain(6):
  '12 Apple'
  '12345'
  '33333'
  '555-1234'
  'C. Brown'
  'Snoopy'
</pre>
  


<h3>
Testing
</h3>

<p>
Here are some ideas for tests.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
A program with extra tokens at the end of the file.
<li>
A program that uses the wrong punctuation.
<li>
A program that has missing punctuation.
<li>
A program with empty fact or rule lists.
<li>
A program with empty scheme or query lists.
<li>
A program with schemes, facts, rules, queries in the wrong order.
</ol>



<h3>
Design
</h3>

<p>
You will build a datalog interpreter in later projects.
The datalog interpreter will need to access the datalog
program data structure created by the parser.
The data structures should be designed such that
the datalog interpreter is able to easily get
the lists of schemes, facts, rules and queries
from the parser.
</p>



<h3>
The Datalog Grammar
</h3>

<p>
The Datalog Grammar defines valid datalog programs.
Use the grammar to write a recursive-descent parser
for datalog programs.
Use the scanner from the previous project
to provide input tokens for the parser.
</p>

<p>
The nonterminals in the grammar
begin with a lower-case letter.
Terminal symbols in the grammar
are written in all upper-case letters.
The word 'epsilon' in the grammar
represents the empty string.
</p>
     
<pre>

datalogProgram	->	SCHEMES COLON scheme schemeList
		        FACTS COLON factList
		        RULES COLON ruleList
		        QUERIES COLON query queryList

schemeList	->	scheme schemeList
schemeList	->	epsilon

factList	->	fact factList
factList	->	epsilon

ruleList	->	rule ruleList

queryList	->	epsilon

scheme   	-> 	predicate
fact    	-> 	predicate PERIOD
rule    	->	predicate COLON_DASH predicate predicateList PERIOD
query	        ->      predicate Q_MARK

predicateList	->	COMMA predicate predicateList
predicateList	->	epsilon
	
predicate	->	ID LEFT_PAREN parameter parameterList RIGHT_PAREN
	
parameterList	-> 	COMMA parameter parameterList
parameterList	-> 	epsilon
	
parameter	->	STRING
parameter	->	ID

</pre>


 
<h3>
Datalog Program Data Structures
</h3>

<p>
A datalog program consists of lists
of schemes, facts, rules and queries.
You are encouraged to use the 'vector'
class from the library for these lists.
Please do not write your own list class.
</p>

<p>
You do need to write classes for the
schemes, facts, rules, and queries
that are stored on the lists.
Because schemes, facts, and queries
all have the same form as predicates,
one class named Predicate can be used
to represent all of these types of objects.
You don't need classes named Scheme, Fact, and Query.
Schemes, facts, and queries can (and should)
be stored in Predicate objects.
</p>

<p>
You are required to have the following classes:
DatalogProgram, Rule, Predicate, and Parameter.
You may also have others, but you must have these.
</p>

<p>
Write a toString method for each of these classes
so that you can easily print them out.
Return a DatalogProgram object from the parser
and then traverse this structure and use toString
as needed to print the required output.
</p>

<p>
To integrate this project with later projects,
be sure to have a way to get the lists
of schemes, facts, rules and queries
out of the DatalogProgram.
</p>

 
 
<h3>
Output Format
</h3>

<p>
If the parse is successful,
output 'Success!' followed by the lists of
schemes, facts, rules, queries in the datalog program.
Output the number of items in each list
as shown in the example output.
Indent each list item by 2 spaces.
Output the schemes, facts, rules, and queries in
the same order in which they appear in the input.
</p>

<p>
Also output the set of the domain values
that appear in the datalog program.
The domain values are the strings
(surrounded by quotes) that appear in the input.
Note that the domain is a set of strings.
(The same string is not printed more than once.)
Output the domain strings in sorted order.
(Sort the strings based on the characters inside
the strings, not including the quotes.)
</p>
 


<h3>
Syntax Errors
</h3>

<p>
If the parse is unsuccessful,
output 'Failure!' followed by the offending token.
Output the type, value, and line number of the token
surrounded by parentheses and indented by 2 spaces
on a new line of output.
Note that the parser stops after encountering
the first offending token.
</p>



<h4>
Example Input
</h4>

<pre>
Schemes:
    snap(S,N,A,P) 
    NameHasID(N,S)
 
Facts:
    snap('12345','C. Brown','12 Apple','555-1234').
    snap('67890','L. Van Pelt','34 Pear','555-5678').
 
Rules:
    NameHasID(N,S) :- snap(S,N,A,P)?
 
Queries:
    NameHasID('Snoopy',Id)?
</pre>
 

  
<h4>
Example Output
</h4>

<pre>
Failure!
  (Q_MARK,"?",10)
</pre>



<h3>
Implementation Requirements
</h3>

<ol>

<li>
You must implement a deterministic top-down parser that
chooses the rule to expand based on the current token.

<li>
You must implement the parser
using the recursive-descent approach.

<li>
You must use the scanner from the previous project
to read tokens from the input.

<li>
You must create classes for
DatalogProgram, Rule, Predicate, and Parameter
to hold the internal representation of a datalog program.
Each class must have a toString method
and the output of the program must be formed by
these toString methods (not by the parse methods).

<li>
The parser must run to completion
with a normal exit status for any input.
Do not terminate with a non-zero exit status for any input,
including inputs that have errors.
</ol>



<h3>
Implementation Suggestions
</h3>

<ol>
<li>
A good approach is to complete the project in three steps:

<ul>
<li>
   First: write a parser that only checks syntax.
      (Does not build any data structures.)

<li>
   Second: write classes for data structures.
      (Rule, Predicate, Parameter, etc)

<li>
   Third: add code to the parser to create data structures.
      This can be done easily without modifying the lines
      of code that were created in the first step.
      For example when a parameter is being parsed a
      Parameter object is created and added to the
      current list of parameters stored in the Parser.
</ul>

<li>
A good approach is to use exceptions to handle syntax errors.
Throw an exception when the parser detects a syntax error.
Catch the exception at the top level of the parser
to report either success or failure.
(Don't return a boolean from each parsing routine to indicate
a syntax error because then each return value must be checked
resulting in more complicated code.)

<li>
A good approach is to make a Parameter object
capable of holding both a 'name' and a 'value'.
The object holds a 'name' if the parameter is a variable
and a 'value' if the parameter is a constant.

<li>
Don't store token types in the data structures
created by the parser.
The data structures created by the parser should be
decoupled from both the scanner and the parser.
</ol>
