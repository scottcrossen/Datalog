BYU CS 236 project
OWNER: Scott Leland Crossen
CONTRIBUTERS:  Scott Leland Crossen

SUMMARY:
For the CS 236 class of byu, a long-term project is required. This is the repository including all of the code used.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- A Makefile is included. "make all" makes the final product. "make test" makes a testing code.
- A "Debug.h" class is included. This allows for the functionality to have a status-print type interface helpful when debugging. It is easily turned off (for when the code is finalized.) by changing the argument in the constructor to Debugger(false) rather than Debugger(true) (which turns it on).
